- [ ] Crypto protocol to encrypt http traffic, like a self made HTTPS. Use a browser frame, and show a self contained custom webpage in the challenge

- [ ] Encrypted upload service like mega

- [ ] Online Password manager like Lastpass

- [ ] KeyVault service to store app passwords

- [x] Simulate a Proxy app like burp or fiddler, where the user sees a few requests made in the past. One of this requests has encrypted content, These requests can be inspected, and one of them has some encrypted content. To send the flag, the proxy app should be able to send raw http requests, the flag should be sent there somehow
